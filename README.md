This are homeworks for the GPUprogramming course in CUDA:

**tut2** is an eigen-vector solver using a CUDA library

**tut3** calculated evolution of heat on a 2D grid with in-the-code defined size of fields

**tut4** calculated evolution of heat on a 3D griw with flexible size of the grid - the code contains also 3 different ways, two of them correctly care about the memory, with the last one, being the fastest.

**partial_sum_on_GPU** contains an in-a-lecture copied GPU parallelization of partial sum of an array.
